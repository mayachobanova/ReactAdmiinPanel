Installation

React-admin is available from npm. You can install it (and its required dependencies) using:

npm install react-admin
#or
yarn add react-admin

Setting Up

React-admin uses React. Weâ€™ll use create-react-app to create an empty React app, and install the react-admin package:

yarn create react-app test-admin
cd test-admin/
yarn add react-admin ra-data-json-server prop-types
yarn start
